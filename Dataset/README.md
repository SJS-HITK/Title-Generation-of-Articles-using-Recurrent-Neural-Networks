There are two folders :

* ArXiv_Dataset - It contains the python notebook named arXiv_crawler.ipynb which collects data from [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) repository in a csv file and logs the results periodically
* Semantic_Scholar_Dataset - It contains a python notebook named Semantic_crawler.ipynb which collects data from [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) Repository and stores in a CSV file

The data from the above two is combined randomly  to generate a compressed dataset which is then preprocessed using the file preprocessing.ipynb

For more details please visit : [Dataset - Google Colab](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)
