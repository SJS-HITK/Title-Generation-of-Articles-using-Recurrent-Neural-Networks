## DATASET

There are two folders :

* ArXiv_Dataset - It contains the python notebook named arXiv_crawler.ipynb which collects data from [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) repository in a csv file and logs the results periodically
* Semantic_Scholar_Dataset - It contains a python notebook named Semantic_crawler.ipynb which collects data from [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) Repository and stores in a CSV file

The data from the above two is combined randomly  to generate a compressed dataset which is then preprocessed using the file preprocessing.ipynb

* Please Download this [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_71U07k_cXUG9H7wPR5zQKavh-fzZbs-/view?usp=sharing) and save here, before running the cells of preprocessing.ipynb
