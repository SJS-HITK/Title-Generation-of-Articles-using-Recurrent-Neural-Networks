## Model without Attention Layer

* This Folder contains Jupyter Notebook for training the simple Recurrent Neural Network Model without Attention Layer 
* We are training this model for comparison of different models
* The Weight are stored periodically, so the training can be stopped at any time, and while training the next time, it will start from the last stored checkpoint
* Before Running the cells make sure the train datasets are present in Dataset folder
